## WHAT I'M DOING NOW

(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.)

### Where

I'm currently living in Saarland, Germany, probably for the rest of my life.

### What

- Working with [anynines](https://anynines.com) on our mission `Fully automating the entire lifecycle of a wide range of data services to run on cloud-native platforms across infrastructures at scale.`, see [Principles and Strategies of Data Service Automation](https://blog.anynines.com/principles-and-strategies-of-data-service-automation-part-1/).
- Trying to figure out how to boost my pension, for example with [ETFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund).
- Helping my kids through challenges of life without being myself a challenge for them.
- Reading stuff about [Cryptography](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642041006).
- Mastering [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

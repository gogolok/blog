Go 1.21 brings the two built-in functions `min` and `max`
to compute the smallest or largest value of a fixed number
of arguments of ordered types.

Only a **fixed number of arguments** is supported.
Go needs to know the number of arguments at compile time.

For **string arguments** the result for `min` is the first argument with the
smallest (or for `max`, largest) value, compared lexically byte-wise.

These new built-ins **will not break your existing code** that already
uses the names min and max. Built-ins arenâ€™t keywords,
so `min` and `max` can be shadowed however you like.

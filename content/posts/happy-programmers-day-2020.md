I love programming.

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ... I’ve got a Nintendo NES. It was
nice to play Super Mario, Mega Man, and other classic games, but the games were
rather expensive. So I convinced my parents to buy an even more expensive
personal computer (PC). Games for the PC were also expensive, so I looked into
other stuff I can do with a PC. I’ve figured out that a PC can be used in many
different ways beyond gaming and I got a book about C++, learned about Linux,
got into the Internet, and found out about the [K Desktop environment (KDE)](https://kde.org/).
This is when I became more familiar with programming and started contributing
to KDE and other Open Source projects.

Programming becomes a bit of a hobby of mine and still is. I’ve loved doing it
in my free time. From there it was an obvious choice to study computer science
and make a living with programming.

I guess everybody should learn to program. It teaches you to think. I’m pretty
sure I will teach my kids how to do it and you should do the same. Also, with
programming or code, you can change the world for the better.
